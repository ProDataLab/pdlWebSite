        Welcome

      <p id="intro-to-prodatalab">
        ProDataLab, a software engineering organization which represents, through years of experience, a philosiphy 
        that software is much more complicated and fragile then it needs to be. From the user's perspective
        or the developer's perspective, the goal is to create a revolution in software engineering that makes 
        the software, and it's development, extremely flexible, intuitive, compartmentalized, scalable, distributable, 
        and universal amongst other goals to solve many of these adverse, anocdotal experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website will eventually become the home portal for ProDataLab's flagship product.. the pdlPlatform. 
        The pdlPlatform will be the software fabric of a system that allows other components to simply plugin and
        become fully integrated with any of the other components. Essentially it is a system that allows
        user interfaces from any hardware or software platform to interact with it. Seperation of concerns and
        their maximal integration is the sole of the system. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The components themselves will be interfaces to, or services of any imaginable discpline and use case.. 
        From the casual user to the most professional, the pdlPlatform will have components that accomodate and 
        integrate. Interfaces will universal on any available hardware platorm. Integration to the other hardware
        systems, for instance automotive or industrial, will also be a focus.. embedded hardware, actuators, sensors..
        the integration potential is limitless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Automation and and software translation is not utilized nearly enough, which is why ProDataLab has a strong
        endearment to the foundations of computer science, and will soon demonstrate that all code can be connected
        and re-purposed. The thought that entrepeneurs and venture capitalists invest millions of dollars to get a 
        new software based innovation of the ground is amusing.
